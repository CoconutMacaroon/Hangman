# Hangman

This is my Hangman game (and because I wanted to learn Electron)

## Contributing

Pull requests are always welcome. However, for bigger changes, consider making an issue for discussion instead. One small thing. Please maintain the code style of the project.

### Code style

Contributions should follow this style (although see the note):  

- Spaces around opperators (so `if(a == b)` not `if(a==b)`)
- Loops/ifs/etc. should have opening bracket on SAME line as operator. So the first line of an `if` would be `if(a == b) {` not `if(a == b)`
- Variables and functions should be camel case. So `someText` not `some_text` or `SomeText` or `Some_Text` or `SOME_TEXT`

> These are guildines, not rules. So if there is a good reason to ignore one (or more) of these, you can. However, I ask that you please put a comment in the code explaining why so that everyone know that it is intentional. Thanks!
